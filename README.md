# "Rusty but fast"

Collection of speedrun-related tools. In theory, my end goal with this project is to update the following tools that I've made for speedrunning:

* [HTML+JS stream overlay](https://github.com/SirGFM/Roa-Stream-Skin)
* [GoFaster (HTTP split tracker)](https://github.com/SirGFM/GoFaster)
* [Key logger (intended for an input viewer)](https://github.com/SirGFM/goLogKeys)

However, it's also my first attempt at using Rust (and quite honestly, mainly an excuse to try that language out).
